# v0.5 Apple Silicon acceptance

Status: procedure prepared, physical Mac execution not yet recorded.
Use an exact candidate build shared with the Windows tester. A published 0.4.x
app cannot validate unshipped 0.5 synchronization. `0.5.0.dev` alone is not a
unique build identity: record the commit and candidate artifact SHA-256.

## Prepare a separate test app

Keep the daily installation. Put the candidate bundle in a separate folder, such
as `~/Applications/Paperfact-v05-test/Paperfact.app`. Do not use the old
`make-app-mac.sh` launcher for acceptance: it points at a mutable checkout and
replaces its launcher destination. Obtain a macOS arm64 bundle built from the
accepted candidate; Windows cannot build or certify its native launch behavior.

On the Mac, first close other Paperfact windows. In Terminal:

```sh
app="$HOME/Applications/Paperfact-v05-test/Paperfact.app"
test_data="$(mktemp -d "$HOME/Desktop/Paperfact-v05-test.XXXXXX")"
"$app/Contents/MacOS/paperfact-cli" --version
PAPERFACT_DATA="$test_data" "$app/Contents/MacOS/Paperfact"
```

Keep this Terminal session and the generated directory for the whole journey.
Reopen with the same last command; creating another directory would test a new
workspace. Check the displayed workspace location before importing. This isolates
research, not the Mac's system credential store or independently installed AI CLIs.
Use your own account only for the explicit AI checks below.

## Acceptance record

Record `pass`, `fail`, or `not run`, with the exact step and expected/actual result.
No elapsed-time or percentage estimate substitutes for these outcomes.

| ID | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| M01 | Open, focus, type Traditional Chinese, switch apps, close normally | Dock/foreground activation works; composition and keyboard shortcuts work; no lost input. |
| M02 | Compare Windows/Mac version and candidate identity | Same candidate; arm64 Mac artifact; daily data folder is not selected. |
| M03 | Import a small synthetic research package containing a PDF, note, explanation and editable deck; import again | Saved content matches; repeat import does not duplicate papers or lists. |
| M04 | Open PDF, follow a saved source, edit a note, reopen the app | Correct original is displayed and local edits survive restart. |
| M05 | Export the list and import it into another empty test workspace | PDF and attachments survive; notes, list name and editable slides retain changes. |
| M06 | Sign into your own supported AI connection; select a model | Effective account/model is visible; other machines' credentials were not imported. |
| M07 | In References, select no auto followup, then explicitly test a maximum of one extra call | Chosen bound belongs to that job; repeated clicks create one job; partial content survives. Extra calls occur only if the response is incomplete. Real AI replies are nondeterministic; use fixture tests to prove the exact bound. |
| M08 | Open sync settings, paste this device's private connection record, load it, then verify | The input is masked and cleared after loading; fields identify this device. Loading alone does not connect, save credentials, enroll or upload research. Invalid input preserves the previous connection. |
| M09 | Connect each device with its own credential to the same test workspace/service | Authentication identifies the expected workspace/device; credentials never travel in a package. |
| M10 | On Mac disconnect network, edit `Mac offline note`, close/reopen | Local save survives; UI reports pending/offline, not fully synchronized. |
| M11 | On Windows edit a different note, then reconnect Mac and sync both | Both independent edits appear on both machines without duplicates. |
| M12 | Offline on both machines, edit the same note differently, then reconnect | Neither edit silently disappears; conflict/recovery keeps both versions and resolution converges. |
| M13 | Interrupt sync, reopen, retry; open another paper during background work | Progress can resume, no duplicated records, no result applied to the wrong paper. |
| M14 | Download/pin PDF on Mac, go offline, reopen it | Verified local original opens; a missing attachment is reported accurately. |
| M15 | Preview and export diagnostics after a reproducible failure | Report identifies this build and OS/CPU; preview matches export; upload requires your action. |
| M16 | Enable automatic sync explicitly, edit locally, wait for the bounded pass, close/reopen | Local changes reach the peer without manual repeat clicks; after restart reconnect and enable session sync again. Loading a record alone does not resume uploads. |
| M17 | Interrupt a large attachment transfer, reconnect, then run the offline file check | Pending/retrying file status remains distinct from metadata caught up; retry yields exact verified bytes. Disconnect only after offline verification passes, then reopen the PDF and editable deck. |
| M18 | From Windows, confirm revocation of the Mac test device; attempt another Mac sync | Future remote access is rejected; locally downloaded research and unsent edits remain. Do not reuse the revoked device ID or delete its outbox. |
| M19 | Create a complete recovery backup, restore into a new detached test directory, inspect both conflict variants and files | Source workspace remains unchanged; restored content and exact attachments are retained. Restore does not reconnect or reactivate the original device identity. A missing required file blocks complete backup rather than silently omitting it. |
| M20 | On a physical phone, open the private PWA, cache selected research, go offline, add a uniquely labeled note, close/reopen, reconnect | Cached research and saved note survive; explicit reconnect delivers the note once to Windows and Mac. Mobile background execution is not required. Test iOS and Android separately; an untested platform remains not run. |


M09–M14 require a deployed, mutually reachable test service and two separately
issued device credentials. `127.0.0.1` on the Mac is the Mac itself. Package
import/export tests do not establish live synchronization. No hosted service is
provisioned by this document. Stop a journey on data loss and retain its test
workspace privately for diagnosis; do not delete/reinitialize to hide a failure.

## Saved startup connection (not run on a physical Mac)

After M09, explicitly enable **Reconnect and sync when this workspace opens on
this device**. Confirm the Keychain prompt identifies Paperfact, close the app,
then reopen the same test workspace. It must authenticate the same device and
sync without re-entering credentials. Repeat offline: local edits must remain
usable and reconnect must back off rather than repeatedly prompting. Clear the
option, close/reopen, and verify there is no automatic connection or upload.
Import or restore into another test database: that database must not inherit the
preference. Record actual Keychain denial and retry separately from fixture tests.

## Shared-service and recovery prerequisites

For M09-M14 and M16-M20, use a disposable workspace and a mutually reachable
service with separate device credentials. Provision a replacement test identity
before M18 so revocation does not prevent later cases. Never paste connection
records into the acceptance report. The [GCP pilot plan](../gcp-sync-pilot-plan.md)
is a proposal, not a deployed endpoint; its public-edge, backup and restore gates
must pass before treating that service as usable away from home.

M19 tests a detached client research backup through the app's recovery actions;
see [the recovery contract](../sync-recovery.md). It does not test restoration of
the cloud authority. Record cloud authority disaster recovery separately, including
fresh service/workspace identity when restoring older history; never reset a
client cursor to disguise lost server history.

For each run, record device/OS, artifact hash, candidate commit, case ID,
pass/fail/not run, expected/actual result and reviewed diagnostic filename.
Keep the Windows/Mac/phone records together. A passing automated test or a package
import cannot fill a physical-device result. Stop on data loss and preserve the
isolated workspace privately for diagnosis.

## Automated packaged-app checks (maintainer)

From the matching candidate checkout on the Mac, with its development environment
already installed and the built bundle available:

```sh
run_id="$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_built_app.py   "$HOME/Applications/Paperfact-v05-test/Paperfact.app"   "build/mac-acceptance-$run_id"
```

The output directory must not already exist. The script generates synthetic data
and isolated account/data homes. It checks first use, duplicate import, export,
file fidelity, local CLI/MCP retries and native Launch Services foreground behavior.
The Mac foreground check requires Apple's Swift toolchain. `report.json` is
written only after successful completion; a missing report is not a pass.
This does not run the physical two-device sync journey or real provider login.
Do not claim the full suite passed merely because packaged-app verification passes.

## Return a useful failure report

Use the candidate's **Diagnostics and support** entry to preview and export.
If its GUI cannot start, use the same Terminal variables:

```sh
PAPERFACT_DATA="$test_data" "$app/Contents/MacOS/paperfact-cli" diagnostics
PAPERFACT_DATA="$test_data" "$app/Contents/MacOS/paperfact-cli" diagnostics   --output "$HOME/Desktop/Paperfact-diagnostics-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).zip"
```

Send the reviewed diagnostic ZIP, M-step ID, candidate version/hash, macOS version,
expected/actual behavior and a redacted screenshot if useful. Review generated
acceptance logs before sharing. Do not publish the whole research workspace,
raw app log, credentials, or private PDFs. Logs can contain earlier failures;
an empty diagnostics report does not prove a frozen UI is healthy.
