# v0.5 Apple Silicon acceptance

Status: procedure prepared, physical Mac execution not yet recorded.
Use an exact candidate build shared with the Windows tester. A published 0.4.x
app cannot validate unshipped 0.5 synchronization. `0.5.0.dev` alone is not a
unique build identity: record the commit and candidate artifact SHA-256.

## Prepare a separate test app

Keep the daily installation. Put the candidate bundle in a separate folder, such
as `~/Applications/Paperfact-v05-test/Paperfact.app`. Do not use the old
`make-app-mac.sh` launcher for acceptance: it points at a mutable checkout and
replaces its launcher destination. Obtain a macOS arm64 bundle built from the
accepted candidate; Windows cannot build or certify its native launch behavior.

On the Mac, first close other Paperfact windows. In Terminal:

```sh
app="$HOME/Applications/Paperfact-v05-test/Paperfact.app"
test_data="$(mktemp -d "$HOME/Desktop/Paperfact-v05-test.XXXXXX")"
"$app/Contents/MacOS/paperfact-cli" --version
PAPERFACT_DATA="$test_data" "$app/Contents/MacOS/Paperfact"
```

Keep this Terminal session and the generated directory for the whole journey.
Reopen with the same last command; creating another directory would test a new
workspace. Check the displayed workspace location before importing. This isolates
research, not the Mac's system credential store or independently installed AI CLIs.
Use your own account only for the explicit AI checks below.

## Acceptance record

Record `pass`, `fail`, or `not run`, with the exact step and expected/actual result.
No elapsed-time or percentage estimate substitutes for these outcomes.

| ID | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| M01 | Open, focus, type Traditional Chinese, switch apps, close normally | Dock/foreground activation works; composition and keyboard shortcuts work; no lost input. |
| M02 | Compare Windows/Mac version and candidate identity | Same candidate; arm64 Mac artifact; daily data folder is not selected. |
| M03 | Import a small synthetic research package containing a PDF, note, explanation and editable deck; import again | Saved content matches; repeat import does not duplicate papers or lists. |
| M04 | Open PDF, follow a saved source, edit a note, reopen the app | Correct original is displayed and local edits survive restart. |
| M05 | Export the list and import it into another empty test workspace | PDF and attachments survive; notes, list name and editable slides retain changes. |
| M06 | Sign into your own supported AI connection; select a model | Effective account/model is visible; other machines' credentials were not imported. |
| M07 | In References, select no auto followup, then explicitly test a maximum of one extra call | Chosen bound belongs to that job; repeated clicks create one job; partial content survives. Extra calls occur only if the response is incomplete. Real AI replies are nondeterministic; use fixture tests to prove the exact bound. |
| M08 | Open sync settings, expand/collapse setup, load a saved connection | Fields retain edits; loading only reveals Verify; no research upload starts until an explicit sync action. |
| M09 | Connect each device with its own credential to the same test workspace/service | Authentication identifies the expected workspace/device; credentials never travel in a package. |
| M10 | On Mac disconnect network, edit `Mac offline note`, close/reopen | Local save survives; UI reports pending/offline, not fully synchronized. |
| M11 | On Windows edit a different note, then reconnect Mac and sync both | Both independent edits appear on both machines without duplicates. |
| M12 | Offline on both machines, edit the same note differently, then reconnect | Neither edit silently disappears; conflict/recovery keeps both versions and resolution converges. |
| M13 | Interrupt sync, reopen, retry; open another paper during background work | Progress can resume, no duplicated records, no result applied to the wrong paper. |
| M14 | Download/pin PDF on Mac, go offline, reopen it | Verified local original opens; a missing attachment is reported accurately. |
| M15 | Preview and export diagnostics after a reproducible failure | Report identifies this build and OS/CPU; preview matches export; upload requires your action. |

M09–M14 require a deployed, mutually reachable test service and two separately
issued device credentials. `127.0.0.1` on the Mac is the Mac itself. Package
import/export tests do not establish live synchronization. No hosted service is
provisioned by this document. Stop a journey on data loss and retain its test
workspace privately for diagnosis; do not delete/reinitialize to hide a failure.

## Automated packaged-app checks (maintainer)

From the matching candidate checkout on the Mac, with its development environment
already installed and the built bundle available:

```sh
run_id="$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_built_app.py   "$HOME/Applications/Paperfact-v05-test/Paperfact.app"   "build/mac-acceptance-$run_id"
```

The output directory must not already exist. The script generates synthetic data
and isolated account/data homes. It checks first use, duplicate import, export,
file fidelity, local CLI/MCP retries and native Launch Services foreground behavior.
The Mac foreground check requires Apple's Swift toolchain. `report.json` is
written only after successful completion; a missing report is not a pass.
This does not run the physical two-device sync journey or real provider login.
Do not claim the full suite passed merely because packaged-app verification passes.

## Return a useful failure report

Use the candidate's **Diagnostics and support** entry to preview and export.
If its GUI cannot start, use the same Terminal variables:

```sh
PAPERFACT_DATA="$test_data" "$app/Contents/MacOS/paperfact-cli" diagnostics
PAPERFACT_DATA="$test_data" "$app/Contents/MacOS/paperfact-cli" diagnostics   --output "$HOME/Desktop/Paperfact-diagnostics-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).zip"
```

Send the reviewed diagnostic ZIP, M-step ID, candidate version/hash, macOS version,
expected/actual behavior and a redacted screenshot if useful. Review generated
acceptance logs before sharing. Do not publish the whole research workspace,
raw app log, credentials, or private PDFs. Logs can contain earlier failures;
an empty diagnostics report does not prove a frozen UI is healthy.
